### Introduction
-----------------

In many Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Karnataka etc., the Indian state has taken control of Hindu temples, with government appointed officers sitting inside Hindu temples as permanent tenants. Introduced to apparently mitigate the effects of corruption within Hindu temples, the acts (such as Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowmments Act or TNHRCE) have, in fact, if anything, added to the increase in corruption (through the state appointed officials) and disapperance of invaluable temple property such as idols and jewels which are then circulated in international black markets for a price before they show up in museums across the world.
